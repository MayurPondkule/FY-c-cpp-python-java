//Why do we need arrays? 
//We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have a small number of objects, but if we want to store a large number of 
//instances,it becomes difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){

// Array declaration by specifying size


// With recent C/C++ versions, we can also
// declare an array of user specified size

int arr[]={1,2,3,4};
cin>>arr[3];


return 0;



}
